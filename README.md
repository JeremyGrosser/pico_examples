# Raspberry Pi Pico Examples (Ada)

Each subdirectory is a standalone project which you can build using [Alire](https://alire.ada.dev/) and flash to a [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/pico-series.html). It is also possible to run the debugger - see the project's own README for details. You can copy whichever project is most similar to your use case to a new location and initialize your git repo there.

This is a relatively new project and you may encounter bugs. Please file GitHub issues or join the development discussion on Gitter: [https://gitter.im/ada-lang/raspberrypi-pico](https://gitter.im/ada-lang/raspberrypi-pico).
